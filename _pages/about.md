# About
Welcome to my blog

I'm a software engineer, mainly specializing in back-end development\
In this blog you can find a variety of articles, but they are mainly related to backend, cloud native and blockchain\
All of the content is based on my own experiences and insights that I have learned along the way.

Hope you'll find something interesting here :)
